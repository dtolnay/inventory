error[E0277]: the trait bound `Thing: inventory::ErasedNode` is not satisfied
 --> tests/ui/submit-unrecognized.rs:3:1
  |
3 | inventory::submit!(Thing);
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ unsatisfied trait bound
  |
help: the trait `Collect` is not implemented for `Thing`
 --> tests/ui/submit-unrecognized.rs:1:1
  |
1 | pub struct Thing;
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  = note: required for `Thing` to implement `inventory::ErasedNode`
  = note: required for the cast from `&Thing` to `&'static (dyn inventory::ErasedNode + 'static)`
  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__do_submit` which comes from the expansion of the macro `inventory::submit` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

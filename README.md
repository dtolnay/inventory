This crate provides a way to set up a plugin registry into which plugins can be
registered from any source file linked into your application. There does not
need to be a central list of all the plugins.

```toml
[dependencies]
inventory = "0.3"
```

*Supports rustc 1.62+*

# Examples

Suppose we are writing a command line flags library and want to allow any source
file in the application to register command line flags that are relevant to it.

This is the flag registration style used by [gflags] and is better suited for
large scale development than maintaining a single central list of flags, as the
central list would become an endless source of merge conflicts in an application
developed simultaneously by thousands of developers.

[gflags]: https://gflags.github.io/gflags/

### Instantiating the plugin registry

Let's use a `struct Flag` as the plugin type, which will contain the short name
of the flag like `-v`, the full name like `--verbose`, and maybe other
information like argument type and help text. We instantiate a plugin registry
with an invocation of `inventory::collect!`.

```rust
pub struct Flag {
    short: char,
    name: &'static str,
    /* ... */
}

impl Flag {
    pub const fn new(short: char, name: &'static str) -> Self {
        Flag { short, name }
    }
}

inventory::collect!(Flag);
```

This `collect!` call must be in the same crate that defines the plugin type.
This macro does not "run" anything so place it outside of any function body.

### Registering plugins

Now any crate with access to the `Flag` type can register flags as a plugin.
Plugins can be registered by the same crate that declares the plugin type, or by
any downstream crate.

```rust
inventory::submit! {
    Flag::new('v', "verbose")
}
```

The `submit!` macro does not "run" anything so place it outside of any function
body. In particular, note that all `submit!` invocations across all source files
linked into your application all take effect simultaneously. A `submit!`
invocation is not a statement that needs to be called from `main` in order to
execute.

### Iterating over plugins

The value `inventory::iter::<T>` is an iterator with element type `&'static T`
that iterates over all plugins registered of type `T`.

```rust
for flag in inventory::iter::<Flag> {
    println!("-{}, --{}", flag.short, flag.name);
}
```

There is no guarantee about the order that plugins of the same type are visited
by the iterator. They may be visited in any order.

## How it works

Inventory is built on runtime initialization functions similar to
`__attribute__((constructor))` in C, and similar to the [`ctor`] crate. Each
call to `inventory::submit!` produces a shim that evaluates the given
expression and registers it into a registry of its corresponding type. This
registration happens dynamically as part of life-before-main for statically
linked elements. Elements brought in by a dynamically loaded library are
registered at the time that dlopen occurs.

[`ctor`]: https://github.com/mmastrac/rust-ctor

Platform support includes Linux, macOS, iOS, FreeBSD, Android, Windows, and a
few others. Beyond this, other platforms will simply find that no plugins have
been registered.

For a different approach to plugin registration that *does not* involve
life-before-main, see the [`linkme`] crate.

### Unsupported OS support

Some "exotic" platforms might support constructors out of the box, but might not
be identified as "supported OS". You can still **"try"** to make this works by
forcing constructors with the following feature `inventory_force_init_array`.
You will have to define this feature in your own project as Inventory injects
code with the `submit!` macro, forcing you to declare the feature yourself.

You can do the same to force the constructors to be defined in the .text.startup
section by using `inventory_force_text_startup`.
